# Data Analysis: S&P Stocks - 2013/2018

### Requisits:

- Pandas 1.0.3
- Seaborn 0.9.0
- Scipy 1.4.1

## Business Understanding
For this project, we use the data provided in the Kaggle "S&P 500 stock data" (https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500), and contains the daily quotation of 505 assets, between the period of February / 2013 and February / 2018.

Our intention in conducting this project is to evaluate the behavior of the price of these assets, and see if it is more advantageous to buy and remain with the asset or, at random, select one of these assets and buy at the beginning of the week and sell at the end of the same week. .

The S&P 500 index in the same period of the data varied from 1,514.68 points in 2013 to 2713.83 in 2018, an appreciation of 79%.

Questions to be answered:

- What is the average valuation of assets in the period?
- Which assets were the most valued?
- Which assets have devalued the most?
- Is it more advantageous to buy and stay with the asset or to carry out the random purchase and stay with the assets for just 1 week?
- In a random way, did we manage to beat the S&P 500 index?
